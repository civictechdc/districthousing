District Housing
================

District Housing lets caseworkers help clients apply for Section 8 housing by automatically filling out multiple PDF applications using one online form.

This application uses the [pdf-forms gem](https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms) and [pdftk](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/).

The application can generate random seed data for testing.  To get the application up and running with seed data, run these commands:

    bundle install
    rake db:setup
    rails server

The seed data creates a test user account with information pre-populated.  The login for the test user is:

    Username: sampleuser@districthousing.org
    Password: password

Code for DC has labeled additional PDFs to work with District Housing.  These are not stored directly in the Git repository, but db/buildings.csv contains seed information about these, including download URLs.  To download these PDFs and load them into District Housing, run:

    rake pull_pdfs

For testing, you can make a bunch of fake applicants and a test user account with

    rake seed_applicants

As a demo, the app can be found at http://districthousing.org/.  Don't enter real data here, or rely on your data sticking around.  It's likely to be reset and upgraded without warning.

## Dependencies

Requires pdftk.  On OS X:

    brew cask install pdftk

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install pdftk

## Installation with Cloud9

If you do not want to go through the trouble of installing Rails on your machine, you can easily set up the development environment with [Cloud9](https://c9.io/). After forking the districthousing repo, sign up for a free Cloud9 account using your Github credentials.

Your fork of districthousing should appear on the left side of your Cloud9 dashboard under 'Projects on Github.' Select it and click 'Clone to Edit.' Choose the pre-configured Ruby on Rails environment. The districthousing fork will now be listed under 'My Projects.' Once cloned, click 'Start Editing.'

To continue using git, run the following in your workspace terminal:

    git remote add districthousing 'git@github.com:[github username]/districthousing'

Install pdftk using apt-get and ensure that you are using ruby-2.1.2. You should now be able to get the application up by running:

    bundle install
    rake db:setup pull_pdfs seed_pdfs seed_applicants
    rails s -b $IP -p $PORT

Navigate to http://districthousing-c9-[username].c9.io to see your app.
