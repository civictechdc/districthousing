<h1>Use your own PDF</h1>

<p>If you obtain a PDF of a housing application, you can use it with
  District Housing.  Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use Adobe Acrobat Pro to add fields to the document.  Name these
    fields according to our field name dictionary.</li>
  <li>Upload the PDF to District Housing from the "Locations" tab.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adding form fields to a PDF</h2>

<p>
  We aren't aware of any free PDF form editors.  This guide will assume you
  are using a paid version of Adobe Acrobat.
</p>

<p>
  To edit form fields, open your PDF in Acrobat and click:
  <ol>
    <li>Tools</li>
    <li>Forms</li>
    <li>Edit</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/edit_forms.png" %>

<p>
  Add a new text field to the form by right-clicking where you want the field
  to go.
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/add_text_field.png" %>

<p>
  Expand the field to take up the whole space.  If you make the field too
  small, you risk cutting off text.
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/use_whole_space.png" %>

<p>
  Give the field a name from our Field Name Dictionary.  The field name determines
  what gets written in that field.  Check your spelling!
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/set_field_name.png" %>

<p>
  Double-click on a field to edit its properties.  In the General properties
  tab, you can change the name.
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/properties_general.png" %>

<p>
  In the Appearance tab, set the font size to something small, such as 6 or 8
  points.  This makes it less likely that text will be cut off when fields are
  filled.
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/properties_appearance.png" %>

<p>
  In the Options tab, set the Alignment to "Left", and consider checking the
  "Multi-line" box, especially if this field will have lengthy content, like an
  address.
</p>

<%= image_tag "pdf_guide/properties_options.png" %>

<p>
  Once you've set all the options, you can right-click the field and click 
  "Use Current Properties as New Defaults".  Then you can save yourself the
  trouble of setting these options for all other new forms.
</p>

<h2>Field Name Dictionary</h2>

<p>
  Here, we will list some basic fields you can fill in for the main
  applicant.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>
      Field name
    </th>
    <th>
      What you get
    </th>
    <th>
      Value for <%= @applicant.identity.full_name %>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <%
    [
      [ "Name", "Full name" ],
      [ "FirstName", "First name"],
      [ "MiddleInitial", "Middle initial"],
      [ "MiddleName", "Middle name"],
      [ "LastName", "Last name"],
      [ "SSN", "Social security number"],
      [ "DOB", "Date of birth"],
      [ "BirthState", "State of birth"],
      [ "BirthCity", "City of birth"],
      [ "Nationality", "Nationality/citizenship"],
      [ "Gender", "The person's gender"],
      [ "GenderInitial", "First letter of gender"],
      [ "Mail", "Applicant's mailing address"],
      [ "Phone", "Applicant's phone number"],
      [ "HomePhone", "Applicant's home phone number"],
      [ "WorkPhone", "Applicant's work phone number"],
      [ "CellPhone", "Applicant's cell phone number"],
      [ "Email", "Applicant's e-mail address"],
      [ "Address", "Applicant's current residential address"],
      [ "MaritalStatus", "Applicant's marital status (Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed)"],
      [ "Occupation", "The user's occupation"],
    ].each do |row| %>
      <%= render "pdf_guide/field_row", name: row[0], what: row[1] %>
    <% end %>
</table>

<h2>Add location metadata</h2>

<p>You can optionally attach location metadata to your PDF.  If you do
  this, you'll be able to see the building it corresponds to on a map.</p>

<p>If you don't do this before uploading the file to District Housing,
  you can still edit the building location manually from within the Locations
  screen.</p>

<p>To add location metadata to your PDF:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open your PDF in Acrobat.</li>
  <li>Click File menu -> Properties...</li>
  <li>Click the Custom tab.</li>
  <li>In the "Name" field, type "Location".</li>
  <li>In the "Value" field, enter the address of this housing location.
    This should be something that Google Maps could find your building
    with.</li>
  <li>Click "Add".</li>
  <li>Click "OK".</li>
  <li>Save your PDF.</li>
</ol>
