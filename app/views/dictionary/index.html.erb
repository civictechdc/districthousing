<h2>Field Name Dictionary</h2>

  PDFs used with District Housing must be labeled correctly, or the forms will not be filled.
  This guide is a dictionary of all the kinds of field names that are supported for form filling.
</p>

<h3>Information about people</h3>

<p>
  Here, we will list some basic field names for information about the applicant.
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [

<h4>Person prefixes</h4>

<p>
  Personal field names can be prefixed with certain patterns to change which person it refers to.
  For example, you can get personal information for the first household member with the
  <code>HH1</code> prefix, as this table shows:
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "HH1Name", "First household member's full name" ],
  [ "HH1Gender", "First household member's gender"],
  [ "HH1Mail", "First household member's mailing address"],
  [ "HH1Phone", "First household member's phone number"],
  [ "HH1Email", "First household member's e-mail address"],
  [ "HH1Occupation", "First household member's occupation"],
  [ "HH1Relationship", "First household member's relationship to the applicant"],
] %>

<p>Increment the prefix number to select the next person of that type:</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "HH1Name", "First household member's full name" ],
  [ "HH2Name", "Second household member's full name" ],
  [ "HH3Name", "Third household member's full name" ],
] %>

<p>
  The available person prefixes are:
</p>

<%= render "prefix_table", prefix_descriptions: [
  [ "LL", "Landlord, starting with current. Matches Address of the same number" ],
  [ "HH", "Household member other than the applicant" ],
] %>

<h3>Yes/No values</h3>

<p>
  Some forms ask for personal information in a yes/no question.  In general, personal
  fields can be suffixed with YN to produce either "Y" or "N" as the field value.  A
  field suffixed with "YesNo" will produce either "Yes" or "No".
</p>

<p>
  When there are more than two states, you can suffix a field name with the
  state you're interested in, followed by "YN" or "YesNo".
</p>

<p>
  The following table should clarify.
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "StudentStatus", "Description of student status" ],
  [ "StudentStatusFullTimeYN", "Y if full-time, N if part-time or not a student" ],
  [ "StudentStatusYN", "Y if full-time or part-time, N if not a student" ],
  [ "MarriedYN", "Y if married, N if not" ],
  [ "MarriedYesNo", "Yes if married, No if not" ],
] %>

<h3>Race and Ethnicity </h3>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "RaceBlackTickYes", "Applicant race identity:Black yes or no" ],
  [ "RaceWhiteTickYes", "Applicant race identity:White yes or no" ],
  [ "RaceNativeAmericanTickYes", "Applicant race identity:AmericanIndian yes or no" ],
  [ "RaceAsianTickYes", "Applicant race identity:Asian yes or no" ],
  [ "RacePacificIslanderTickYes", "Race is Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander" ],
  [ "RaceOtherTickYes", "Race is \"Other\"" ],
  [ "RaceDeclineTickYes", "Applicant race identity:Do not wish to Answer yes or no" ],
  [ "EthnicityHispanicTickYes", "Applicant race identity:Hispanic yes or no" ],
  [ "EthnicityNonHispanicTickYes", "Applicant race identity:NonHispanic yes or no" ],
  [ "EthnicityDeclineTickYes", "Applicant race identity:No Answer yes or no" ],
] %>

<h3>Addresses</h3>

<p>
<code>Address</code> should be used when talking about a residence address.  <code>Mail</code> should be used when talking about a mailing address.
</p>

<p>
  Addresses can be suffixed with address components to get just that part of the address.  For example:
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "Address", "Full residence address" ],
  [ "AddressStreet", "Residence street address" ],
  [ "AddressCity", "Residence city" ],
  [ "AddressState", "Residence state" ],
  [ "AddressZip", "Residence zip code" ],
  [ "AddressApt", "Residence apartment" ],
  [ "AddressStart", "Start date of this address" ],
  [ "AddressEnd", "Start date of this address" ],
  [ "AddressLeaseExpDate", "Date that the lease expires at this address" ],
  [ "AddressRent", "Rent amount in USD at this address" ],
  [ "Mail", "Mailing full address" ],
  [ "MailStreet", "Mailing street address" ],
  [ "MailCity", "Mailing city" ],
  [ "MailState", "Mailing state" ],
  [ "MailZip", "Mailing zip code" ],
  [ "MailApt", "Mailing apartment" ],
] %>

<p>
  Addresses can be numbered to indicate previous residence addresses.  <code>Address1</code> is the same
  as <code>Address</code>, <code>Address2</code> is the first previous residence address, and so on.
  Component suffixes work for previous addresses the same way they do for the current address.
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "Address", "Current residence address" ],
  [ "Address1", "Current residence address" ],
  [ "Address1City", "Current residence address city" ],
  [ "Address2", "First previous residence address" ],
  [ "Address2State", "First previous residence address state" ],
  [ "Address3", "Second previous residence address" ],
  [ "Address4", "Third previous residence address" ],
] %>

<p>
  You can use person prefixes with addresses.
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
  [ "Mail", "Current mailing address of applicant" ],
  [ "HH1MailZip", "First household member's mailing address zip code" ],
  [ "HH2MailStreet", "Second household member's street mailing address" ],
  [ "LL1Mail", "Current landlord's mailing address" ],
  [ "LL2MailState", "Previous landlord's mailing address state" ],
] %>
